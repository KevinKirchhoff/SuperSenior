<h2>A little about Study Fox</h2>
    <div class="one">
    Study Fox is a novel idea that connects students that want to study with other students who have the same goal in mind, to succeed in their classes. This idea was thought up and created by team Super Seniors during the 2017 Boise State Appathon. We all want to succeed in our classes and this application will connect students with other students that want to work together.

    Team Super Senior consists of three members Melissa Bower, Ali Alkhateeb, and Kevin Kirchhoff. All three students are computer science majors in their last semesters, Melissa has already obtained an undergratuate in Mathematics.

            Hi, my names Kevin Kirchhoff I am one of the creators of Study Fox. I tutored computer science for more than a couple years and now I am working for the ISPM research lab working with Dr. Gaby Dagher, my main focus is privacy. I wanted to help develop this app because I think it is a great idea for people that want to study to meet other individuals with the same goal in mind. When I was a freshman I was very intimidated by computer science and had a hard time connecting with people because I was shy. If I had this app around that time I feel it would have helped me immensly in my classes and I could have made more friends a long the way.</p>
